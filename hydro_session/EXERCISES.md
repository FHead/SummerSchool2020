# HOMEWORK

1. Study the viscous effects on hydrodynamic evolution

Simulate a Pb+Pb collision in 20-30% centrality at 5.02 TeV. In order to
compare simulations with different viscosity, we need to fixed the
random seed. You can choose your favorate number for the seed. (42?)

* Compare the averaged temperature evolution with and without bulk viscosity
* Compare the development of averaged radial with and without bulk viscosity
* Compare the development of flow anisotropy as a function of proper time
with two different shear viscosity

2. Produce animation for the temperature and flow velocity profiles in the
transverse plane

Step 1. Pick your favorate collision system and generage hydrodynamic
evolution file.

Step 2. Modify the Jupyter notebook to read in hydrodynamic evolution file
and produce animation for energy density and flow velocity.

3. [Bonus] Compute particle spectra and flow anisotropic flow Qn vectors
from the event-by-event simulations for one heavy-ion collison system.
